# RoverContracts

Here is an Opportunity to seize the Spirit of rovers! Have I piqued your 
Curiosity? YuTu can send manned and unmanned rovers across the system and 
run them for years beyond their intended life span until the wheels crumble!

This contract pack offers two new missions: 
1. Rover Deployment: encourages you to send rovers to planets/moons where 
   you don't have them. 
2. Rover Expedition: Detects a location near your rover and requests whatever 
   scientific experiments the rover is equipped with be completed at that 
   location. The more capable the rover, the greater the returns. Take the 
   mission as often as you want and enjoy the challenge and immersion of 
   navigating and studying alien terrain!

Requires Contract Configurator 1.5.3 or newer. 
Waypoint Manager is HIGHLY recommended.

THANK YOU, nightingale, for your tireless work and patient help.
